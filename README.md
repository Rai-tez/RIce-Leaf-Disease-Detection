# Rice-Leaf-Disease-Detection

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tedisetiady/leaf-rice-disease-indonesia

Includes:
Preprocessing of the images
architectures
multi and single prediction

Classes/types of Rice Leaf Diseases:
- Blast
- Blight
- Tungro

Machine Learning project that detects if any of the Rice leaf images
are infested with one of the three types of diseases available in the dataset.

What this study lacks is the presence of normal rice leaf without any of the diseases.

descs:
CNN-BILSTM-ATTENTION++.ipynb - initial ntbk we ended up with
CNN-BILSTM-ATTENTION-V2++(WITH AND WITHOUT ATTENTION) - the main ntbk
Prediction - separate ntbk for running existing models that has been outputted 
by CNN-BILSTM-ATTENTION-V2++(WITH AND WITHOUT ATTENTION) for single image predictions
